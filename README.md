# Slack Sample App
This app is a simple demonstration of how to connect to slack, pull down users and view a user's profile. It has two views, one that lists all of the slack user's names and another that shows the user's profile when their name is clicked on.  

# 3rd Party Libraries
1. Retrofit 2.0 - This is my preferred way to implement REST API's. This makes accessing and digesting JSON data very easy.
2. Picasso. This is a very easy to use library for downloading and displaying images.
3. My SQL Library. I use my SQLite database code for creating databases with very little code.
4. RecyclerView - Used for displaying lists of items
5. AppCompat - Good compatibility class for notifications and views that can be used on both newer and older Android platforms.
6. My Log Library. Useful for logging. Contains lots of useful code.
7. Support v13 - Library. Includes v4 classes.	ViewPager, Notification Compat files, FragmentManager, etc.
